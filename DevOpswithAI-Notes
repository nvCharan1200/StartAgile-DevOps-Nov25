What is AIOPS and why AIOPS?

IT industry is dependent on SDLC
This SDLC gives us various model
Waterfall model
Agile mythology 
DevOps principles
AIOPS -> AI + OPS
Use of AI capabilities in the IT operations
AI ops is not just for IT industry- its for everyone
AIOPS : wherever in business that involves operations and automation using AI

Exisitng Automation Example:
Auto scaler :
CPU usage is 80%
Memory usage is 50% 
then scale up the VM
Here : we have set a rule -> and an action to take place (REACTION)

But now if AI is included with it: 
check the data based on the rule-> Observation Friday 5pm -> bring up 50 VM

Analyze the data based on the rule ->Proactively take the action

The major difference between DevOps and AI Ops: 
In DevOps we have automation 
AI ops we use algorithms, intelligence on given data and analyze and automate
AI is adding value to our IT operations.

AI : People, technology, process 
physical servers --> data centers -> VM -> Containers
With AI as people we learn new technologies and new process to improve ourselves.

3 main pillars of AIOPS:

- Data 
AIOps includes integrating with the Existing Systems to collect lots of data over a period of time
Observation and monitoring data on application
- Analytics : Difference between Analysis and Analytics?
Collecting data about your car? 
 - fuel?
 - engine?
 - battery?
 - tyre?
Analyze the data and come to a conclusion- take an action
Analytics : Analyze data based on previous actions, current actions and take necessary decisions even before the problem occurs
It is a continuous process
- Automation

Analytics pipleine:
====================
RAW data -->gets cleaned up -->Analyzed -> see it on the dashboard -> actions automatically 

Collection of RAW data is also called as Data Ingestion
===================
In the real time from the application the generated data is collected.
kafka
AWS kinesis

Example:
==============
Custome name, id, date, time, location, products, order

Data Storage 
========================
Use a central location to store the data for:
historical analysis 
processing 
machine learning 

Tools: S3 buckets
Datawarehouse tools : snowflake

Data Processing:
=======================
- enriching the data 
- removing duplicates
- structuring the data 

Tools:
Spark 
AWS glue 
kinesis Analytics


Data Modeling/ Data Analytics (predicting & insights )
We use ML model that will run on the given data and predict the output

Tools: 
Sagemaker
sciket/pandas
spark ML

Visualization: display the predicted analysis and insights 
Tools:
tableau
looker
quicksight

MLOPS:
=============================
MLOps refers to a practice and discipline within Machine learning that aims to unify and streamline
the machine Learning system, dev and operations
It involves collaboration between data scientists, ML engineers and IT professionals to automate and optimize 
the end to end lifecycle of ML application

based on the example we make below conclusions:
============================================
1. Data management system 
2. Version control system 
3. Automation - pipeline
4. Experiment tracking
5. Delivering
6. Monitoring/ feedback ->Retraining
7. Setup new infrastructure 
8. licenses and security

MLOPS -> DEVOPS + data engineering
We need to know how to make ML models and deploy them in our environments using Devops tools 
========================================
Generative AI
=======================================
Gen AI is a class of AI
that generates models that will create new content like text, image, video That resembles human created data 

Traditionally AI was - give an input and give an output- ai tool will find patterns on the give input and output 
and give predictions

Generative AI: where we learn form the give data and generates a new data based on it

On a gen AI model -> upload lots of images of cat  and tell this is a cat->
 will analyze all the images - generate an image/data how a cat will look it.

GEN AI -> RAG - Retrival augment based chatbots

Changing it form reactive to proactive 
Add agents to your exiting ai tool -> agentic gen AI

Agentic AI means an AI system  that can act independently to achieve the desired goal
plans -> decides ->acts -> observe -> adapt

It executes tasks, its active, works in a loop.
